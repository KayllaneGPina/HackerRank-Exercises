# Java If-Else 

In this challenge, we test your knowledge of using *if-else* conditional statements to automate decision-making processes. An if-else statement has the following logical flow:

### Task

Given an integer, ***n***, perform the following conditional actions:

- If is odd, print `Weird`
- If is even and in the inclusive range of to , print `Not Weird`
- If is even and in the inclusive range of to , print `Weird`
- If is even and greater than , print `Not Weird`

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not ***n*** is `weird`.

---

### Input format

A single line containing a positive integer, ***n***.

---

### Constraints 

- ***1< = n <= 100***

---

### Output Format

Print `Weird`if the number is weird; otherwise, print `Not Weird`.

---

### Sample Input 0

`3`

`Weird`



### Sample Input 1

`24`

`Not Weird`

---

### Explanation

Sample Case 0: ***n = 3***

***n*** is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print `Weird`.

Samples Case 1: ***n = 24***

***n > 20*** and ***n*** is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print `Not Weird`.
